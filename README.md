# Student Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Student Data Analysis Project! This project demonstrates how raw CSV data can be transformed into meaningful insights using SQL and Power BI.

## Project Overview

This repository contains:

* A CSV file with student marks data
* SQL scripts to analyze the dataset (using aggregate functions, filters, grouping, and more)
* An interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize trends, distributions, and performance metrics

The goal is to showcase how data can be cleaned, queried, and visualized to drive academic or institutional insights.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

* Student details (Roll No, Name, Section, Course)
* Subject-wise marks
* Performance indicators

## SQL Analysis Highlights

Key insights derived using SQL include:

* Count of students scoring above 90 in each subject
* Section and course-wise performance grouping
* Usage of WHERE, GROUP BY, and other simple clauses
* Data aggregation and filtering examples

You can find all SQL queries in the `code.sql` folder.

## Power BI Dashboard

Explore interactive visuals such as:

* Course & Section-wise high-scorer distribution
* Subject-wise average marks
* Heat maps and bar charts for quick comparisons
